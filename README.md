This was final project coded under guidence of Dr. Kevin Austin. This project covers all the python concepts and additionally I had implemented mathplot for the visualization of the data.
The program analyses user input related to an earthquake, explosion, nuclear explosion, or rock burst, conducts an analysis, and generates sets of data visualizations and graphs and city affected near the radius of the earthquake.
I filtered CSV data files using Python by removing bad data and setting it to default values so that I donâ€™t lose the rows.
List and dictionaries are two types of data structures that provide convenient access to data when the data, such as rows and columns, is converted into a structured format.
